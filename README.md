# CubeControlSupportLib
A C++17 support library for the LPC1114 microcontroller and auxiliary Cube Controller board functions.

This library implements the registers and register functions of several of the core and perihperal blocks in the LPC1114 Microcontroller, and implements several convenience functions for interacting with the external board peripherals.

It is far from complete and only implements the functionality I am using in the CubeControl LED Cube Control Board as I develop it, but will be expanded more over time.
